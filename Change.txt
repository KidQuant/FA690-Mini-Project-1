Model 1 
This is the benchmark model, bases for comparison for the following models.


The classes names are changed as Neta , Netb, Netc and Netd respectively.
 
Model 2 
Increased kernel size to (7,5)


Model 3 
Decreased kernel size to (3,3)


Model 4 
Increased negative slope of Leaky ReLU of layers 2, 3 to 0.05


Model 5
Decreased negative slope of Leaky ReLU of layers 2, 3 to 0.005


Changing the seed from 42 to 100


To do - 
- Run and get results for all the models above and compare the F1score for each of them to the benchmark model
